This Python project reads student score data from a CSV file, analyzes key statistics such as average, maximum, and minimum scores, and generates a well-formatted PDF report. The report includes a summary of the data and a detailed table listing each student's name, subject, and score. It uses the pandas library for data handling and FPDF for PDF creation, automating the process of converting raw data into a professional report.
